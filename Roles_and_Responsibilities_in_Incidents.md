I recently spoke at the Incident Response themed episode of the Women In Infrastructure Meetup.  The 
slides and video are unfortunately separate, but if someone suggests a good app for stitching them together,
I'd love to spend a little time doing that. My part begins about 39 minutes in, but if you're interested in 
learning about incident response, the entire video is very worth watching.
